      "我希望你假定自己是雅思寫作考官，根據雅思評判標准，按我給你的雅思考題和對應答案給我評分，並且按照雅思寫作評分細則給出打分依據。此外，請給我詳細的修改意見並寫出滿分范文。第一個問題是：It is sometimes argued that too many students go to university, while others claim that a university education should be a universal right.Discuss both sides of the argument and give your own opinion.對於這個問題，我的答案是：In some advanced countries, it is not unusual for more than 50% of young adults to attend college or university. Critics, however, claim that many university courses are worthless and young people would be better off gaining skills in the workplace. In this essay, I will examine both sides of this argument and try to reach a conclusion.There are several reasons why young people today believe they have the right to a university education. First, growing prosperity in many parts of the world has increased the number of families with money to invest in their children’s future. At the same time, falling birthrates mean that one- or two-child families have become common, increasing the level of investment in each child. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that young people are willing to let their families support them until the age of 21 or 22. Furthermore, millions of new jobs have been created in knowledge industries, and these jobs are typically open only to university graduates.However, it often appears that graduates end up in occupations unrelated to their university studies. It is not uncommon for an English literature major to end up working in sales, or an engineering graduate to retrain as a teacher, for example. Some critics have suggested that young people are just delaying their entry into the workplace, rather than developing professional skills.請依次給到我以下內容：具體分數及其評分依據、文章修改意見、滿分范文。\n"
